/**
 * @file Pqxx.h
 * @brief Wrap libpqxx header files, and provide version-specific tailoring.
 *
 * @description
 * The C++ Postgres client library libpqxx version 4.0 has eliminated
 * the necessity to declare types when preparing an SQL query.  See
 * this message on the libpqxx-general mailing list and its replies:
 *
 *  http://lists.pgfoundry.org/pipermail/libpqxx-general/2012-July/000680.html
 *
 * In the near term we must build with different versions of the
 * library, so this header file encapsulates the API differences.  All
 * code that needs to access Postgres should use it.  See
 * src/system/catalog/SystemCatalog.cpp for an example of its use.
